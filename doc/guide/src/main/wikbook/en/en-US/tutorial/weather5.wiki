Now it's time to introduce action controllers, actions are method annotated by the ##@Action## annotation. Unlike
views, actions are only called when an action url is processed by the portal, whereas a view controller method can
be invoked any time by the portal.

The role of an action controller is to process actions parameters. Each parameter of an action controller method is
mapped to the incoming request processed by the portal, such parameters can be encoded directly in the URL or be
present in the form that triggers the action.

In our example, we use a form which contains the the #location# action parameters. In order to create an action
url we use the same syntax shown for view url ##@{add()}## but this time we don't need to set any parameter, instead the
form parameters will be used when the form is submitted. However this is not mandatory and instead we could have
url parameters such as ##@{add(location = 'washington'}##, such syntax is valid specially when it is used without a form.
Obviously there is the possibility to mix form and action parameters.

When the url is processed, the following action controller method will be invoked:

{{java}}
{@include examples.tutorial.weather5.Weather#add(java.lang.String)}
{{/java}}

The method process the ##location## parameter and add it to the ##locations## set. After this the portal
will proceed to the page rendering phase and will call the ##index()## method to refresh the application.
