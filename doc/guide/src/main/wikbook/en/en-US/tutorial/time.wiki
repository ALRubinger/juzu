We will show a quick overview of Juzu templating system. Templates are essentially made of static part (usually
markup) and dynamic parts. In this section we will only explain how to use dynamic expression in a template.

The time application shows how a view can provide dynamic input for a dynamic template. Our application has a view
controller and a template, but how the template contains the ##${time}} expression that makes it dynamic

{{code href=examples/tutorial/time/templates/index.gtmpl/}}

Like before this template is used in the view controller

{{java}}
{@include examples.tutorial.time.Time#index()}
{{/java}}

During the template rendering, the //time// expression will be resolved to the value provided by the view controller.
When a template is invoked, an optional map can be provided, this map will be available during the rendering of the
template for resolving expression.
