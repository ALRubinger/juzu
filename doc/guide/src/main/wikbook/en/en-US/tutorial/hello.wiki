The Hello World applications shows a basic Juzu application. Our application is declared in the ##examples.tutorial.hello##
package package annotated with the ##@Application## annotation This annotation declares a Juzu application and does
not require any mandatory value. Like classes, methods or fields, Java packages can be annotated, such packages declaration
are represented by a special file named ##package-info.java##.

Usually an application contains controllers and templates, in this example, the ##Hello## Java class contains a method
annotated with the ##@View## annotation, which turns the ##Hello## class into a Juzu controller. The controller method
##index()## is the name of the default method that Juzu will call when no other method is explictly specified.

{{java}}
{@include examples.tutorial.hello.Hello#index()}
{{/java}}

Methods annotated by ##@View## have the unique purpose of providing markup, in this case, the method delegates the
rendering to the ##index.gtmpl## template. The template is injected in the controller thanks to the ##@Inject## annotation
qualified by the ##@Path("index.gtmpl")## annotation.

{{java}}
{@include examples.tutorial.hello.Hello#index}
{{/java}}

By default templates are located in the ##templates## package of the application, in our case the
##examples.tutorial.hello.templates## package. The templates are located in the same source tree than the java classes because
the files must be available for the Java compiler.
